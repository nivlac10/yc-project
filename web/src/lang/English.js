【Stay in Control】
Gaming should be seen as a fun form of entertainment, not a way to make a profit. While most people may view gambling as a form of entertainment and only risk what they can lose, it can be more difficult for some people.

To keep track of your gaming habits, always remember the following:
．Gaming should be moderate and used as leisure, not as a true source of income.
．Avoid chasing losses; there will always be a new day.
．Only play when you can cover your losses.
． Track the time and amount you spend on the game.
．If you need to take a break from gaming, you can enable self-exclusion for one or all products by contacting our support team.
．If you need to speak to someone about any gambling concerns, please contact one of the organizations listed below.

【You have a problem?】
If you are concerned that gambling is having a negative impact on your life or the lives of others, the following questions may help you find answers.

．Is the game interfering with your work or studies?
．Do you play to pass the time or to avoid boredom?
．Do you often play alone for long periods of time?
．Has anyone ever criticized your game?
．Have you lost interest in family, friends or hobbies due to gambling?
．Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you spend gambling?
．Have you ever lied, stolen or borrowed money to support your gambling habit?
．Do you feel reluctant to spend "game money" on anything else?
．Would you continue gambling until you lost all your money?
．After losing, do you feel the need to play again as soon as possible?
．Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to play?
．Does gambling cause depression or suicidal thoughts?

		Contralavagemdedinheiro: 'Against money laundering',

		．Our AML policy reinforces investor protection, secure payment procedures for investors and secure services for customers.

		．Identification documents: Clear copy of the front and back sides of a government-issued photo identification document such as a valid passport, driver's license or national identification card.

		AutoExclusão: 'Self-Exclusion',
		AutoExclusãoFont: `【Self-Exclusion Policy】
		This policy summarizes our commitment to responsibly dealing with gambling and its potential impact on people. While subscription-based social lotteries pose the lowest risk of problem gambling, we recognize that some players may not be able to enjoy these activities healthily.
		
		【What is self-exclusion?】
		Self-exclusion is a formal procedure by which an individual can choose to stop participating in gambling.
		
		【How does self-exclusion work?】
		You can do this by contacting:
		．European Casino Association: europeancasinoassociation.org
		．National Council on Problem Gambling: ncpgambling.org
		．Global Gambling Guidance Group: gx4.com
		．Gamblers Anonymous: gamblersanonymous.org
		．GamBan: gamban.com
		Gambling Filters and Prevention:
		．NetNanny: www.netnanny.com
		．GamBlock: www.gamcare.org.uk
		
		【How long is self-exclusion valid?】
．The minimum period of self-exclusion will be no less than 6 months and no more than 12 months.
．The exclusion period may be extended in 6-month increments after the original exclusion period ends.
．For remote gambling such as websites and telephone registration, individuals will have a maximum of 5 years of option.
．After the designated self-exclusion period ends, self-exclusion will continue for a further 7 years unless the individual takes active steps to return to gambling before this period.

For non-remote gambling, such as coupon sign-up, self-exclusion will continue for a further 6 months after the end of the original self-exclusion period unless the individual takes active steps to return to gambling before this period.
If an individual chooses not to extend self-exclusion and makes any active request during the 6 months after the end of the self-exclusion period for non-remote gaming or during the 7 years after the end of the self-exclusion period for remote gaming, they will have a 24-hour waiting period before being allowed to enter sweepstakes again.
Regardless of an individual's chosen self-exclusion period, we will not send them marketing materials unless and until they request or agree to receive them.

【Personal responsibility】
．By requesting self-exclusion, the individual agrees to provide complete and accurate personal information now and in the future to ensure that we can limit access to our services.
．If an individual chooses to self-exclude, we will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the self-exclusion. However, by agreeing to self-exclusion, the individual makes a parallel commitment not to attempt to circumvent self-exclusion by providing misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information, or otherwise attempt to avoid the agreed self-exclusion.
．We therefore assume no responsibility or liability for any consequences or losses that the individual may suffer or incur if they start or continue to gamble after self-exclusion, for providing misleading, inaccurate or incomplete information or for attempting to circumvent the agreed self-exclusion.

【Offering Support】
Although most people gamble responsibly, gambling can become a problem for some people. As part of our commitment to socially responsible gaming, we provide the following guidelines for individuals participating in our lotteries:
．Gaming should be for entertainment, not a way to make money.
．Avoid chasing losses.
．Bet only what you can afford to lose.
．Track the time and money you spend on gambling.
						`,
		ProteçãodosMenores: 'Protection of Minors',
		ProteçãodosMenoresFont: `Betting at online casinos is mainly for entertainment purposes. However, a small portion of people may lose control during the game. Before starting to play, it is essential to understand that games should not be considered a source of income or a means of paying off debts.
		．It is useful to track the time and money spent at online casinos every day.
		．We only accept players who are at least 18 years old and employ all applicable methods to prevent minors from registering and playing at our casino.
		．Casinos have the right to request proof of age, and if players are not of legal playing age, access to the site will be denied.
		．However, we recognize that due to the spread of the internet, people under the age of 18 can still register and play at online casinos.
		．Therefore, we strongly encourage parents to collaborate to protect their children against unauthorized access to betting sites.
